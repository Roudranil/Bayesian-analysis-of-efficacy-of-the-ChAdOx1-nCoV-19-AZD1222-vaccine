This repository contains all the codework and the final document for my dissertation project due at the end of my UG program.
Here, we shall be performing a Bayesian analysis of the efficacy of a certain vaccine against Covid-19, and making some deductions on basis of that.

That code has been written in Python, and is available under the MIT license.
